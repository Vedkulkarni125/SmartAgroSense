 Smart AgroSense 🌿 – Wireless Agriculture Monitoring System

This is a final-year capstone project focused on smart agriculture using ESP32, NRF24L01 wireless communication, IoT cloud (Blynk), and MATLAB-based system visualization.

 🚀 Features
- Many-to-one wireless architecture using NRF24L01
- Real-time monitoring of soil moisture, temperature, and humidity
- Blynk integration for mobile dashboard and push notifications
- Offline auto-irrigation fallback logic (Node 3)
- MATLAB 3D visualization and Simulink simulation

🧠 Technologies Used
- ESP32, Arduino (C/C++)
- NRF24L01 (2.4GHz communication)
- DHT22, Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor
- Blynk IoT Platform
- KiCad (circuit design)
- MATLAB & Simulink
